So right now I can
    create an account
    manually get prices
    create a tam based on the account and prices
    manually calculate trades or possibly send those to a current trade function
    send those trades to tam to update
    repeat until no more trades are needed

So I still need a, but not in this order
    model class that holds model positions
    function that accepts Account objects, model object, and prices (optional)
    trade class to hold trades
