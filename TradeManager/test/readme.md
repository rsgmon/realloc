To generate test data you must open the file generate_all_test_data.ps1. This powershell script has multiple commands that operate on test/test_data/test_data_generator.py. 

Most of the lines are blanked out as I've already created the test_data for that test. 

Once you run the powershell script use the path of the destination in your unit test.
