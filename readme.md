A modular Python library for managing and rebalancing multi-account investment portfolios.

It handles account-aware trade allocation, portfolio-level targets, and execution constraints across multiple real-world accounts.

---

## Features

- Allocate trades across multiple accounts
- Enforce constraints (e.g. no negative positions, long-only models)
- Fully tested with `pytest`
- Clean, modular, extensible API
- Includes plugin architecture allowing for custom exporters, validators, and rebalancers.

---

## Installation

Clone the repo and install in editable mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/realloc.git
cd realloc
pip install -e .[dev]
```

## Quick Start 

from realloc import Account, PortfolioModel, PortfolioAllocator

### Define accounts
accounts = [
    Account("IRA", "A1", 1000, {"AAPL": 5}, {}),
    Account("Taxable", "A2", 2000, {"GOOG": 3}, {})
]

### Define target model
model = PortfolioModel("Balanced", {"AAPL": 0.5, "GOOG": 0.5})

### Define prices
prices = {"AAPL": 100, "GOOG": 200}

Ok now what? You've got everything you need to do a basic trade, but how? This is where we try to allow the user to take control. Don't get us wrong! We've built ready-made objects to do the work and they do. 

However, if you professionally rebalanced portfolios, you'll know there's an art to it and there's not always one answer. We're just saying we recognize that. But, that topic is for another day.

So back to basic rebalancing. Essentially, it's iterative (trial and error). We loop through accounts and positions checking cash, checking targets vs. actual until we arrive at a set of trades.

The next step is to calculate portfolio level trades. For that we've provided three functions:

`calculate_portfolio_positions`,`calculate_target_shares`, `compute_portfolio_trades`

Call these in this order to get a list of portfolio level trades. Yeah, we could have a wrapper, maybe we'll make one, maybe not.

`PortfolioStateManager`, while not required will help you manage the state of everything while calculating trades. You can roll your own but why?

Instantiate a new `PortfolioStateManager`.

Now you're ready to try to rebalance. For this quick start we have a basic but tested built-in rebalancer. It's in pluggable but you can import directly.

```
from realloc.plugins.rebalancers.default_rebalancer import DefaultRebalancer

rebalancer = DefaultRebalancer(...)
rebalancer.execute_rebalance
```

BOOM! Trades. They're not tax-aware, and no constraints like "Don't buy stock DVL" are in place. But that's actually more common than you'd think. So if you're not concerned about taxes or constraints, you'll probably be ok.

But how do I get the trades into a format, so I don't have to hand input. Ah, we have a plugin for exporting. Ours is basic, but you can build a broker-specific one.

```
from realloc.plugins.exporters import csv_exporters
```

But wait, there's more! 

### `rebalance-cli` 
This is a ready-made script that demonstrates a full re-balance (not just a slice re-balance) of realloc. 

Input Format

To use `rebalance-cli`, you must provide a JSON file with:

- `prices`: { symbol â†’ float }
- `accounts`: list of "account" dictionaries
- `model`: `Portfolio` model with `name` and `targets`

Example:
```json
{
  "prices": { "AAPL": 100, "GOOG": 100 },
  "accounts": [
    { "label": "A", "account_number": "1", "cash": 1000, "positions": { "AAPL": 5 } }
  ],
  "model": {
    "label": "Balanced",
    "targets": { "AAPL": 0.6, "GOOG": 0.4 }
  }
}
```

# Several Plugin Types are available
### 1. Rebalancer PluginsCustomize how trades are allocated across accounts:
```
from realloc import PortfolioModel, Account, PortfolioStateManager from realloc.plugins.core.base import RebalancerPlugin
```
#### Use the default rebalancer
```
rebalancer = RebalancerPlugin.load_rebalancer("default")
```

#### Execute rebalance using the plugin
```
trades = rebalancer.execute_rebalance( tam=PortfolioStateManager(...), target_shares={"F":100, "HPQ":50}
```


### 2. Export Plugins
Format trades for different brokers:

```
from realloc.plugins.core.base import Exporter
```
### Export trades to CSV
```
exporter = Exporter.load_exporter("csv", path="trades.csv") exporter.export(trades)
```


### 3. Validator Plugins
Add custom trade validation rules:
```
from realloc.plugins.core.base import TradeValidator
# Validate minimum trade value
validator = TradeValidator.load_validator("minimum_value", min_value=100) is_valid, message = validator.validate(trade)
``` 

### Using Plugins with CLI
The `rebalance-cli` supports plugins through command-line arguments:
```
bash
# List available plugins
list-plugins
# Use an exporter plugin
rebalance-cli input.json --exporter csv --export-path trades.csv
``` 

### Available Plugins
- **Rebalancers**:
  - `default`: Standard rebalancing algorithm
- **Exporters**:
  - `csv`: Export trades to CSV format
- **Validators**:
  - `max_position`: Enforce maximum position sizes
  - `minimum_value`: Enforce minimum trade values
```
